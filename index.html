SpeakOut is a text-to-speech application which has many different uses. It was originally written to speak and store voice commands for a smart speaker. I could never remember the exact commands for certain features, so I wrote this app to remember and speak them for me. However, it can also be useful for assisting people who have vocal impairments. Simply type what you want to say and have the computer do the talking.

It can also create a list of your commonly used commands or phrases. Press the &quot;Remember&quot; button to start or add to your own personalized list. Once created, you can just select from the list with no need for typing anything. After selecting an item, it is automatically filled in for you and ready to speak.

<h2>Phone Number Converter</h2>

<span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>
You hear or see phone numbers all the time from companies or organizations who give out a catchy easy-to-remember phone number which uses their name in the phone number. For instance, &quot;just call us at 1-800-CallUsNow for more information&quot;. Well, that may sound good... accept when you actually try to call it or enter it into your contacts. You end up staring at the keypad on your phone searching for the
numbers corresponding to those letters you're supposed to dial. This process can be very frustrating and time consuming.
</span>
</p>
		
<p class=MsoPlainText>
<span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>
That's where Phone Number Converter comes in. Just load the app, type in the number including the letters and press &quot;Convert&quot;. Now you have the phone number with all the corresponding numbers to dial or enter wherever you need it.
