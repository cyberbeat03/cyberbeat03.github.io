<p>
You will need to have the Microsoft Windows Media Player installed on your operating system for WinMix Desktop to function. Most versions of Windows include Windows Media Player by default. However, you may need to install it as an optional feature. You should make sure it is installed and working properly on your device.</p>
<p>WinMix Desktop has been tested and optimized for .NET Framework 7.2. If this version is not installed, or if you aren't sure,  the setup process will automatically check the version and install it for you if necessary.</p>

          Performance will depend on how much memory and processing speed you have. The more the
          better. Each device and Windows version are different which makes it difficult to give exact hardware and software configuration requirements.

<p>
However, here are some general issues to consider. If you have a lot of music then you will need a large hard drive with plenty of free space. You should have as much storage available as possible. WinMix Desktop can run with very little memory.  You should have 4 to 8 gb, but keep in mind that the more RAM you have will make the app run smoother and faster.
