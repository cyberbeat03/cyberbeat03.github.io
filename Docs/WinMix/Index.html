                <p>
                    WinMix Desktop is an accessible easy-to-use music player with many features to help organize and play your music. It was designed specifically to be user friendly for the blind and visually impaired. It has a straight forward interface making it
                    compatible with screen readers, screen magnifiers and other assistive technology. All functions in the program have associated keyboard shortcuts which make it
                    user friendly from the keyboard as well as the mouse.

                    WinMix Desktop makes it easy to locate and organize your music on your PC. It does this through the use of playlists. These playlists can be generated for you automatically or you can quickly create and personalize your own. This desktop app will access your music library to let you access existing playlists and files. It will not, however, delete any files. If you choose to have WinMix Desktop remove a playlist or file, it only removes the entry to the item in your music library and the file remains on on disk.
